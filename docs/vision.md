# Project Vision

## Problem Statement

**Core Problem**: Individual taxpayers lack motivation to consistently track deductible expenses throughout the year, leading to lost tax savings and poor financial habits.

**Primary Issue**: This is fundamentally a **motivation problem** - people know they should save receipts but don't see immediate value, creating a delayed gratification gap between effort (scanning receipts) and reward (tax savings months later).

**Secondary Issue**: Knowledge gaps about what expenses are deductible compound the motivation problem, making people unsure if their effort will pay off.

**Impact**: Average taxpayers leave $1,000+ in legitimate deductions unclaimed annually due to poor record-keeping habits, not lack of qualifying expenses.

## Project Vision & Goals

### Vision Statement
Create an open-source, privacy-first mobile application that transforms tax deduction tracking from a chore into an engaging habit by providing **immediate visual feedback** on potential tax savings for each scanned receipt.

### Primary Goal: Habit Formation
**Objective**: Help users develop consistent receipt-scanning habits through immediate gratification and gamification, leading to maximized tax deductions and improved financial awareness.

### Secondary Goals:
1. **Educational Impact**: Increase user understanding of tax-deductible expenses through contextual learning
2. **Community Building**: Leverage open-source development to build a sustainable, trustworthy financial tool
3. **Privacy Leadership**: Demonstrate that powerful financial apps can respect user data ownership

## User Personas & Scenarios

### Primary Target: Individual Consumers (B2C Focus)

#### Priority Persona: "Freelance Sarah" (Ages 25-35)
- **Profile**: 1099 contractors, gig workers, side hustlers
- **Core Need**: Maximize tax savings from business expenses
- **Key Scenario**: Scans coffee shop receipt → immediately sees "$2.40 potential tax savings" → feels motivated to continue habit
- **Usage Pattern**: Daily scanning, focused on **low-frequency, high-value** transactions (equipment, professional services, significant meals)

#### Secondary Personas:
- **"Small Business Bob"**: Solo entrepreneurs needing professional expense tracking
- **"Busy Professional Amy"**: W-2 employees with business travel/home office expenses

### Key User Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: High-Value Transaction Capture
Sarah buys a $800 laptop for work → scans receipt → app shows "~$200 potential tax savings" → achievement unlocked → shares progress with community

#### Scenario 2: Educational Discovery
Bob scans restaurant receipt → app explains business meal deduction rules → learns about 50% limitation → makes informed decision about future expenses

#### Scenario 3: Year-End Preparation
Amy reviews annual progress → sees $3,200 in tracked deductions → exports clean report for tax professional → saves hours of organization

## Success Criteria

### Primary Success Metric: User Retention
- **Target**: 60% monthly retention, 30% annual retention
- **Rationale**: Sustainable habit formation is the core value proposition

### Secondary Success Indicators:
1. **User Satisfaction**: 4.5+ app store rating, positive review sentiment
2. **Community Engagement**: Active GitHub contributions, feature requests, user-driven improvements
3. **Download Growth**: Organic growth through word-of-mouth and community building
4. **Educational Impact**: User surveys showing increased tax knowledge

### Key Performance Indicators:
- Average receipts scanned per user per month (target: 8-12 high-value transactions)
- Time from download to first receipt scan (target: <24 hours)
- User progression through gamification levels
- Feature adoption rates for educational content

## Scope & Constraints

### In Scope (MVP):
1. **Mobile-first receipt scanning** with OCR for amount/vendor extraction
2. **Immediate tax savings display** with conservative estimates
3. **Basic gamification** (progress tracking, achievements, levels)
4. **Educational tooltips** explaining deduction rules
5. **Local-first data storage** with user-controlled cloud sync
6. **Open-source codebase** with community contribution framework

### Out of Scope (MVP):
- Complex multi-state tax calculations
- Direct tax filing integration
- Advanced business expense categorization
- Team/family sharing features
- Professional tax advisor network

### Constraints:
1. **Legal**: Must clearly disclaim "estimates only" - not professional tax advice
2. **Technical**: Local-first architecture limits some advanced features
3. **Resource**: Open-source development requires sustainable community model
4. **Platform**: iOS/Android native apps (no web-first approach)

## Key Assumptions & Risks

### Critical Assumptions

#### **High Confidence**:
1. **Market Demand**: Users want better tax deduction tracking (validated by research)
2. **Technical Feasibility**: Mobile OCR and local storage are proven technologies
3. **Legal Viability**: Disclaimer-based approach sufficient for estimate-only app

#### **Medium Confidence**:
1. **Behavior Change**: Users will change receipt habits for immediate gratification
2. **Gamification Effectiveness**: Achievement systems will drive sustained engagement
3. **Open Source Adoption**: Community will contribute to development and trust

#### **Requires Validation**:
1. **Value Threshold**: What minimum potential savings motivates scanning behavior?
2. **Educational Balance**: How much tax education enhances vs. complicates experience?
3. **Privacy Premium**: Will users choose privacy-first over feature-rich alternatives?

### Risk Assessment

#### **High Risk - High Impact**:
- **User Adoption Failure**: Gamification doesn't drive lasting behavior change
- **Mitigation**: Extensive user testing, iterative gamification refinement

#### **Medium Risk - High Impact**:
- **Legal Challenges**: Tax calculation accuracy concerns or regulatory changes
- **Mitigation**: Conservative estimates, clear disclaimers, legal review

#### **Low Risk - Medium Impact**:
- **Open Source Sustainability**: Community contributions insufficient for growth
- **Mitigation**: Clear contribution guidelines, welcoming onboarding process

### Open Questions Requiring Research:
1. What's the minimum viable engagement frequency for habit formation?
2. How do users respond to conservative vs. optimistic tax savings estimates?
3. What gamification elements drive retention without feeling manipulative?

## Strategic Positioning

### Competitive Moat: Open Source + Privacy
**Sustainable Advantage**: Unlike proprietary competitors, open-source approach builds:
- **Trust**: Users can verify privacy claims and calculation methods
- **Community**: Contributors become advocates and power users
- **Adaptability**: Community can extend features faster than corporate development cycles
- **Defensibility**: Network effects through community, not just technology

### **[Vision → Product]** Handoff

The vision prioritizes:
1. **Habit formation** over feature complexity
2. **Individual users** over business customers  
3. **High-value transactions** over micro-expenses
4. **User retention** over revenue metrics
5. **Open source community** over proprietary advantages

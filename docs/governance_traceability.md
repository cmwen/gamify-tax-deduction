# Governance Traceability Matrix

*Last Updated: 2025-09-07*

## Overview
This document maintains cross-references between all project artifacts, audits traceability gaps, and records governance decisions to ensure methodology integrity across the full software development lifecycle.

---

## Document Status Audit

### Current Documentation State
‚úÖ **Complete & Current**:
- `/docs/vision.md` - Strategic foundation established
- `/docs/product_backlog.md` - Backlog created and prioritized  
- `/docs/design.md` - Technical and UX design documented
- `/docs/research/` - Comprehensive market/technical research completed

üîç **Exists but Requires Update**:
- `/docs/execution_log.md` - Placeholder only, needs initial entry
- `/docs/qa_plan.md` - Placeholder only, needs QA strategy

‚úÖ **Repository Scaffolding Status**:
- `.gitignore`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `LICENSE`, and README are all in place and current.
- Flutter `lib/` + `test/` structure established; deprecated multi-platform `src/` scaffolding retired to reduce confusion.
- CI workflow enforces linting, tests, and documentation link checks.

## Vision ‚Üí Design Alignment Review

### ‚úÖ **ALIGNED: Core Strategic Elements**

#### 1. Problem Statement Alignment
**Vision**: "Individual taxpayers lack motivation to consistently track deductible expenses"
**Design**: UI/UX flow designed around "frictionless habit formation" with immediate reward screens

#### 2. Technology Strategy Alignment  
**Vision**: "Open-source, privacy-first mobile application"
**Design**: 
- Local-first, 3-tier architecture ‚úÖ
- Dual-native approach for community contribution ‚úÖ
- SQLite with transparent, auditable storage ‚úÖ

#### 3. User Focus Alignment
**Vision**: Primary persona "Freelance Sarah" (1099 contractors)
**Design**: Core user scenarios prioritize high-value business transactions ‚úÖ

#### 4. Success Criteria Alignment
**Vision**: "User retention" as primary metric
**Design**: UI flow optimized for habit formation with immediate gratification loop ‚úÖ

#### 5. MVP Scope Alignment
**Vision**: "Mobile-first receipt scanning with immediate tax savings display"
**Design**: Epic 2 delivers exactly this scope with conservative estimates ‚úÖ

### ‚úÖ **GAPS RESOLVED - DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS COMPLETE**

#### 1. Educational Component Now Fully Specified ‚úÖ
**Vision**: "Educational tooltips explaining deduction rules" listed as MVP scope
**Design**: Section 3.5 provides complete educational content integration strategy
- Contextual tooltip system with micro-learning approach
- Progressive educational content based on user experience level
- Multiple integration points (Dashboard, Reward screen, Receipt detail view)

#### 2. Gamification System Fully Detailed ‚úÖ
**Vision**: "Basic gamification (progress tracking, achievements, levels)"
**Design**: Section 3.6 provides comprehensive gamification framework
- 4-category achievement system (Scanning, Savings, Consistency, Learning)
- Multi-metric progress visualization 
- Detailed UI mockups and notification system
- Psychology-based approach avoiding manipulation

#### 3. Community Contribution Framework Designed ‚úÖ
**Vision**: "Open-source codebase with community contribution framework" 
**Design**: Section 3.7 specifies complete contributor experience
- Structured onboarding flow for new contributors
- CONTRIBUTING.md template and requirements
- In-app community features and attribution system

## Definition of Done (DoD) Gate Audit

### Documentation Completeness Gate
‚úÖ **PASSING**: Repository scaffolding and documentation traceability
- Vision ‚Üí Product ‚Üí Design chain is complete and well-linked
- Cross-references use proper labels ([Vision ‚Üí Product], [Product ‚Üí Design])
- README/Implementation docs reflect the current feature set

### Repository Hygiene Gate  
‚úÖ **PASSING**: Flutter workspace structure + hygiene tooling verified

---

## Risk Assessment & Governance Decisions

### High Priority Risks
1. **Repository Foundation Risk (HIGH)**
   - **Issue**: Missing basic project structure blocks all implementation
   - **Decision**: **BLOCKING GATE** - No implementation until scaffolding complete
   - **Owner**: Execution Agent
   - **Deadline**: Next session

2. **Community Strategy Gap (RESOLVED)**
   - **Issue**: Open-source vision not fully reflected in contributor experience design
   - **Resolution**: Section 3.7 provides complete contributor framework design
   - **Status**: ‚úÖ Complete

### Design Specification Completeness (RESOLVED)
- **Educational Content**: ‚úÖ Fully specified in Section 3.5
- **Gamification System**: ‚úÖ Comprehensive framework in Section 3.6  
- **Community Framework**: ‚úÖ Complete contributor experience in Section 3.7

### Approved Waivers
None at this time - all blocking gates must be resolved.

---

## Governance Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **[Governance ‚Üí Execution]**: **BLOCKING** - Create repository scaffolding before any feature development

### Process Improvements
1. **Documentation Links**: Add navigation between all docs in headers/footers
2. **Version Control**: Implement document versioning strategy for major changes
3. **Review Cadence**: Establish regular governance checkpoints during implementation

### Completed Actions ‚úÖ
1. **[Governance ‚Üí Design]**: Educational content integration specified ‚úÖ
2. **[Governance ‚Üí Design]**: Achievement system design completed ‚úÖ  
3. **[Governance ‚Üí Design]**: Community contribution framework designed ‚úÖ

---

## Next Review Checkpoint
**Trigger**: After repository scaffolding completion
**Focus**: Execution readiness audit and QA plan alignment review
**Owner**: Governance Agent

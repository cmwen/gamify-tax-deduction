# Execution Log

## Implemented Features

### ✅ Epic 1: Foundational Scaffolding & Hygiene
- **Project Structure**: Created complete directory structure as specified in design
  - `src/app/`, `src/features/`, `src/core/`, `src/platform/`, `tests/`
  - Platform-specific directories for iOS and Android
- **Repository Hygiene**: 
  - Comprehensive `.gitignore` for iOS and Android development
  - `README.md` with project overview and setup instructions
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md` with detailed contribution guidelines
  - `LICENSE` file (MIT License)
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflow (`ci.yml`) with:
  - Linting for both platforms
  - Build and test jobs for iOS and Android
  - Documentation link checking
- **Data Models**: 
  - TypeScript interfaces in `src/core/DataModels.ts` for shared specifications
  - Swift data models for iOS platform
  - Kotlin data classes for Android platform with Room annotations

### ✅ Basic Platform Setup
- **iOS Project**: 
  - Xcode project structure with proper configuration
  - SwiftUI-based dashboard with MVP layout
  - Basic test infrastructure
  - iOS 15.0+ target with modern Swift features
- **Android Project**:
  - Gradle build configuration with Jetpack Compose
  - Material 3 theme implementation
  - Room database setup for local storage
  - Android API 24+ support
- **Testing Infrastructure**:
  - Unit tests for data models (iOS: XCTest, Android: JUnit)
  - Basic CI/CD test execution setup

## Code Changes & Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Dual-Native Approach**: Confirmed Swift/SwiftUI for iOS and Kotlin/Jetpack Compose for Android
2. **Local-First Data**: All data models designed for local storage only
3. **Currency Handling**: Using integer cents throughout to avoid floating-point precision issues
4. **Test-Driven Foundation**: Established comprehensive test suites from the start

### Data Model Design
- **UserProfile**: Secure local storage for income bracket and filing status
- **Receipt**: Core entity with UUID, image path, amounts in cents, OCR verification flag
- **Achievement**: Gamification framework with categories and unlock tracking
- **UserProgress**: Aggregated statistics and streak tracking
- **EducationalTip**: Content system with trigger conditions and display limits

### Platform-Specific Implementations
- **iOS**: Native Swift enums and structs with Codable conformance
- **Android**: Room entities with proper type converters for Date and List<String>
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing across both platforms with equivalent data structures

## Integration Notes

### Cross-Platform Consistency
- Data models maintain identical structure across TypeScript, Swift, and Kotlin
- UI layouts follow similar patterns with platform-appropriate styling
- Both platforms use the same color scheme and design language

### Future Integration Points
- **OCR Integration**: Ready for Apple Vision (iOS) and Google ML Kit (Android)
- **Database Layer**: iOS ready for GRDB.swift, Android uses Room
- **Achievements System**: Extensible framework for adding new achievement types
- **Educational Content**: Dynamic content delivery system with contextual triggers

## Technical Debt

### Current Limitations
1. **Placeholder Project Files**: Xcode project uses simplified structure (needs full project generation)
2. **Android Resources**: Missing drawable resources and manifest configuration
3. **Build Scripts**: Gradle wrapper is placeholder (needs full Gradle wrapper setup)
4. **Asset Management**: No app icons, images, or other visual assets yet

### Planned Improvements
1. **Full Xcode Project**: Generate complete Xcode project with proper build phases
2. **Android Manifest**: Complete manifest with camera permissions and intent filters
3. **Asset Pipeline**: Implement shared asset management across platforms
4. **Localization**: Prepare for future internationalization support

## Suggested Tests

### Unit Tests (Implemented)
- ✅ Data model creation and validation
- ✅ Currency conversion (cents to dollars)
- ✅ Default configuration validation
- ✅ Achievement system basics

### Integration Tests (Next Phase)
- [ ] Database CRUD operations
- [ ] Settings persistence
- [ ] Achievement unlock logic
- [ ] Progress calculation accuracy

### UI Tests (Future)
- [ ] Dashboard navigation
- [ ] Receipt scanning flow
- [ ] Settings screen functionality
- [ ] Achievement display

### Platform Tests (Future)
- [ ] iOS: Keychain storage for UserProfile
- [ ] Android: Room database migrations
- [ ] Cross-platform: Data model serialization

## Next Implementation Steps

### Immediate (Next PR)
1. **Complete Project Setup**: Full Xcode and Android Studio project generation
2. **Database Layer**: Implement local storage with GRDB.swift and Room
3. **Basic Navigation**: Implement screen navigation between dashboard, settings, receipt list

### Short Term
1. **OCR Integration**: Implement native OCR frameworks
2. **Camera Integration**: Add receipt scanning functionality
3. **Achievement System**: Implement progress tracking and unlocks
4. **Educational Content**: Add contextual tip system

### Medium Term
1. **Data Persistence**: Full local database with migrations
2. **Settings Screen**: Complete app configuration
3. **Receipt Management**: List, edit, delete receipt functionality
4. **Gamification UI**: Progress visualization and celebration animations

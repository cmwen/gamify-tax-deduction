# Execution Log

## 2025-10-23 â€“ Receipt Flow & Quality Pass
- Added in-app receipt review screen so users can correct totals, vendor, and category before saving.
- Persisted vendor/category metadata and exposed a full receipt list with sorting and refresh support.
- Tightened achievement loading to avoid missed unlocks during first-run scenarios.
- Retired unused experimental TypeScript scaffolding and aligned documentation/tooling with the Flutter app.
- Updated QA/documentation artifacts to reflect current implementation and testing approach.

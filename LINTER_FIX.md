# Linter Error Fix

## Issue
After implementing the enhanced achievement system, the CI pipeline reported a linter error:

```
error • 'MockAchievementService.checkAchievements' ('Future<void> Function(int?, double?)') 
isn't a valid override of 'AchievementService.checkAchievements' 
('Future<List<Achievement>> Function(int, double)') 
• test/core/services/achievement_service_test.mocks.dart:158:20 • invalid_override
```

## Root Cause
The mock file (`achievement_service_test.mocks.dart`) was generated before we changed the `AchievementService.checkAchievements()` method signature from:
- **Old**: `Future<void> checkAchievements(int receiptCount, double totalSavings)`
- **New**: `Future<List<Achievement>> checkAchievements(int receiptCount, double totalSavings)`

The new signature returns the list of newly unlocked achievements, which is needed for displaying achievement notifications.

## Solution
1. **Removed unnecessary mock**: The test was mocking `AchievementService` itself, which wasn't needed. We only need to mock `DatabaseHelper`.

2. **Updated test file**: Modified `test/core/services/achievement_service_test.dart`:
   - Removed `AchievementService` from `@GenerateMocks` annotation
   - Updated tests to validate the returned list of newly unlocked achievements
   - Added new test for `clearNewlyUnlocked()` method
   - Added test for multiple simultaneous achievement unlocks

3. **Regenerated mock file**: Created new `achievement_service_test.mocks.dart` with only `MockDatabaseHelper`

## Changes Made

### test/core/services/achievement_service_test.dart
```dart
// Before
@GenerateMocks([DatabaseHelper, AchievementService])

// After
@GenerateMocks([DatabaseHelper])
```

### New Test Cases Added
- ✅ Validates that `checkAchievements()` returns newly unlocked achievements
- ✅ Tests `clearNewlyUnlocked()` functionality
- ✅ Tests multiple achievements unlocking simultaneously

### test/core/services/achievement_service_test.mocks.dart
- ✅ Removed `MockAchievementService` class entirely
- ✅ Kept only `MockDatabaseHelper` with proper method signatures

## Verification
The fix ensures:
1. ✅ No type mismatch errors
2. ✅ Tests properly validate new return type
3. ✅ Mock file matches actual service interface
4. ✅ All existing tests still pass
5. ✅ New functionality is properly tested

## Best Practice Note
When changing service method signatures:
1. Always regenerate mocks with `flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`
2. Or, as done here, manually update/remove unnecessary mocks
3. Update tests to validate new behavior
4. Ensure CI pipeline passes before merging

**Status**: ✅ Fixed
**Date**: 2024
**Impact**: No functional changes to application code, only test infrastructure updates
